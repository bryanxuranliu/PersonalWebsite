	<h3> So here's my quick blurb... </h3>
	<img src="Screen Shot 2022-08-12 at 3.16.58 PM.png" alt="Bryan" width="256" height="192">
	<p> Thanks for stopping by! My name is Bryan and I graduated from Cal Poly over in San Luis Obispo, CA in Spring 2022 with a bachelors of science in mathematics and a 
	minor in statistics. There, I primarily focused my studies with a computer science emphasis. Outside of work I am passionate about photography, playing music (piano, flute, and trying to relearn violin), and hiking. <br><br>

	<h3> Well, I try to be book smart... </h3>
		<p> <b> Programming: </b> <br> <br> My main focus during undergrad. Python and Java are my primary and strongest coding languages. 
			I also worked with R in almost of all of my statistics courses, and worked in front-end 
			development in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (what you are seeing on this website right now!). <br> <br>
			<I>languages in order of proficiency: </I>
			<br><br>
			Python, Java, C#, R, JavaScript, CSS, C
			<br><br><hr>
		    <b> Data Science, Statistics, Financial Mathematics: </b> <br> <br> I have studied the many fields of statistics
			including Bayesian inference, probability models, and survival analysis. I am passionate about using my statistics knowledge to conduct tests 
			and work with risk management. <br><br><hr>
			
		    <b>Psychology (hobbyist): </b><br> <br>
			Although not a part of my undergraduate studies, I love studying psychology and learning about the human brain and behavior as a hobby. Hopefully I can 
			apply my statistics proficiency in this field one day.

	<summary> Plane Ticket: Cost Predictor </summary>
	<p> <I> Languages used: Python </I> <br><br>If you're anything like me, you love to travel. My network from college is in California, and frequently I need to snag a plane ticket to fly from Seattle
		to California. But can I use regression analysis to go from making a blind purchase to a more "educated" purchase? Let's find out. <br> <br>

			<Summary> Define Parameters </Summary>
			<p>What things influence the cost of a plane ticket? The truth is there are far too many, many of which is unknown to those outside of airline companies. But some factors 
				that are unanimously agreed upon are the distance traveled, temporal gap between time of ticket purchased and flight date, and number of layovers.
