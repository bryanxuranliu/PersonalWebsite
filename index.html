	<h3> So here's my quick blurb... </h3>
	<img src="Screen Shot 2022-08-12 at 3.16.58 PM.png" alt="Bryan" width="256" height="192">
	<p> Hello visitor! My name is Bryan and I graduated from Cal Poly over in San Luis Obispo, CA in 2022 with a bachelors of science in mathematics and a 
	minor in statistics. There, I primarily focused my studies with a computer science emphasis. Despite data science and 
	programming being my core domain expertise, I also have delved into and have interests in other fields including business, 
	consulting, and graphics design. <br><br>

	<h3> Well, I try to be book smart... </h3>
		<p> <b> Programming (Core Domain Expertise): </b> <br> <br> My main focus during undergrad. Python and Java are my primary and strongest coding languages. 
			I also worked with R in almost of all of my statistics courses, and worked in front-end 
			development in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (what you are seeing on this website right now!). 
			Beyond that, I know a little C. <br> <br>
			<I>languages in order of proficiency (paranthesis indicates a tie): </I>
			<br><br>
			Python, Java, C#, R, (JavaScript, CSS), C
			<br><br><hr>
		    <b> Data Science (Core Domain Expertise): </b> <br> <br> My secondary focus during undergrad. I have worked in SQL and Excel. Organizing 
			and optimizing numerical data, as well as prediciting data using regression analysis are my strong suits. <br><br><hr>
			
		    <b> Business: </b> <br> <br> My tertiary focus during undergrad. I have knowledge in accounting, financing, as well as 
			intermediate level economic theory. I plan to obtain an MBA in the near future. <br> <br><hr>
			
		    <b>Graphics Design: </b><br> <br>
	Although not a part of my undergraduate studies, I work with graphics design in my free time. I hope to work in graphics design/communication
			for at least a small portion of my work-life tenure.

<div id = "Work Experience" class = "tabcontent">
<h3> "What are you up to this summer?" <br> "Ohhh... y'know, just work :3" </h3>
	<p> (the above is a conversation I had with a barista I met at a coffee shop. Never have I ever felt her words so relatable) <br><br> 
		<I> For conciseness and relevance purposes, I will not list the retail/food jobs I have served over the past half decade.</I>

	<p> <b> Glissando Lake Tutoring </b> <br> 
		<I> Sept. 2021 - present </I> <br>
		This is a private tutoring company I founded. The goal is to provide tutoring to younger
	students, many of whom school does not come as easy for them and need specific assistange and care towards the manner in which they are taught. I
	worked with a small group of my friends to provide this service to dozens of students. </p>

	<summary> Plane Ticket: Cost Predictor </summary>
	<p> If you're anything like me, you love to travel. My network from college is in California, and frequently I need to snag a plane ticket to fly from Seattle
		to California. But can I use regression analysis to go from making a blind purchase to a more "educated" purchase? Let's find out. </p>
